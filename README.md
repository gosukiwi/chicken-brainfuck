# CHICKEN Brainfuck
This is an interactive interpreter for the 
[Brainfuck](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) programming language.

## Usage
Simple enough. Just execute the generated `build/brainfuck` executable.

## Compile
To compile, you'll need the CHICKEN Scheme compiler, then just run `make`.

## TODO
There are still many things pending. For example, right now it prints the
integer value instead of a character value.
